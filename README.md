small, and practically weightless program that spam opens programs to fill up ram, thus annoying the user.

LIGHT = Opens programs every 10 seconds. Can only be cancelled by closing R8R

Medium = Opens programs every 5 seconds. Can only be cancelled by closing R8R

Heavy = Opens programs every second. Can only be cancelled by closing R8R

Ultra = Opens programs consistentnly, without waiting. This is likely to crash the computer VERY Quickly (unless you have a NASA SuperComputer lol), and as such cannot be cancelled. 

NOTE: Heavy is likely to cause your computer to crash, dependant on how long its left running for, The version of windows the user is running and the Amount of RAM the PC has. PC's with 16GB of RAM and Up are likely to be lightly effected. 

Ultra WILL CRASH YOUR PC. If you are running this on your own system to see how effective it is, SAVE ANY WORK before you run it.

have fun :)
