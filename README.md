small, and practically weightless program that annoys the computer.

LIGHT = Opens programs every 10 seconds. Can only be cancelled by closing R8R

Medium = Opens programs every 5 seconds. Can only be cancelled by closing R8R

Heavy = Opens programs every second. Can only be cancelled by closing R8R

NOTE: Heavy is likely to cause your computer to crash, dependant on how long its left running for, The version of windows the user is running and the Amount of RAM the PC has. PC's with 16GB of RAM and Up are likely to be lightly effected. 

have fun :)
